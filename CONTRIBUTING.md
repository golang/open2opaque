# How to contribute

This repository is an export of a Google-internal repository.

We are currently not well set up to accept contributions, but are looking into it.

If you want to suggest a code change, you can send it via [GitHub pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). We can then
apply it internally and release it (but not merge your pull request directly).
